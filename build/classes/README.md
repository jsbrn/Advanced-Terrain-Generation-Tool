# Advanced-Terrain-Generation-Tool
An application to create large, open 2D worlds using procedural and other methods of random generation.

## Setup

This project is built in the Netbeans IDE (v7.3.1, but I am sure you can use a more recent version). I am fairly certain that the GUI forms are *only* compatible with Netbeans, so here are the instructions to set this project up on your machine.

1. Install Netbeans (at least 7.3.1).
2. Ensure that you have Java 8.
3. Create a new, empty project in Netbeans.
4. Find where the new project is saved and clone this repository into *the src folder inside the project folder* so that Netbeans can see it. The *.git* and *readme.md* files should be in this *src* folder. [See this.](https://i.imgur.com/UbsiUhi.png) [And this.](https://i.imgur.com/G2dpbCH.png)

5. Once you've done that, you should be OK to run the project in Netbeans.

## Contributing

If you are doing something with the code, please make a branch for it. When you're done with it, submit a pull request to `dev`.

`master` should always be clean and known to work. `dev` is the staging phase where we can sort out merge conflicts and other issues, so all branches should eventually merge into `dev`, not `master`. Thus, both branches are protected and cannot be directly written to.

This way, the project can stay organized and efficient.
